The likelihood function determines how well does a particular function fit our data. This is usually the case when we
have a bunch of data, let's say the housing prices and the houses being bought, we do not inherently know which
distribution our data fits best into.

The likelihood is the inverse of probability in this sense, since in the case of probability, we have the distribution
and we make an estimate, but in likelihood, we have the data and we try to model the inherent distribution itself.

We can assume that there is some likelihood function L that takes as input the set of parameters, and as output gives
the probability that these parameters best fit our data. These parameters could be the weights that we assume in a
linear regression model, and we could try to maximize them using the Likelihood function.
